## Brief
While modern banks have evolved to serve plethora of functions, at their core, banks must provide certain basic
features. The Banking API platform is to build the basic REST API for one of those banks which can be consumed by
multiple frontends(web, IOS, Android, etc).

## Features
- [x] There should be API routes that allow them to:
    - Authenticate users
    - Create a new bank account for a customer, with an initial deposit amount. A single customer may have multiple bank accounts.
    - Transfer amounts between any two accounts, including those owned by different customers.
    - Retrieve balances for a given account.
    - Retrieve transfer history for a given account.
- [x] All endpoints should only be accessible if an API key is passed as a header.
- [x] All role-based endpoints should require authentication.
- [x] Write tests for your business logic.
- [x] Provide a documentation (published with Postman) that says what endpoints are available and the kind of parameters they expect.
- [x] You are expected to design all required models and routes for your API.
